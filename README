Some string manipulation routines for Python. I expect these mostly to be
oriented at processing things like HTML and user inputted text.

This just includes an escape function for HTML-escaping text. From my
measurements this is not significantly faster than cgi.escape for str object
(which isn't too surprising, considering how highly optimized the replace
method of str objects is) but it is 2x to 4x faster on unicode strings.

I've also included a linkify function (which only works on unicode at the
moment and will be updated soon).
