Some string manipulation routines for Python. I expect these mostly to be
oriented at processing things like HTML and user inputted text.

I've measured the escape routine to be about 2x faster than cgi.escape but my
version is still fairly unoptimized so I hope to get even better than that. I
think there are some bugs because I've had it segfault (but not reliably).
